<h1>Using SSH keys</h1>

<p>A SSH connection can be established using a password -the password of the user's account on the SSH host-.  
	This is the basic setting, and it requires the user to enter the password on each access.</p>

<p>A more convenient approach can be achieved using SSH keys. Basically, a SSH key is generated, that includes 
	in fact a pair of cryptographic keys -a public encryption key and a private decryption key.
	The public one is transferred to any host where a SSH session is required.
	The private one remains on the client machine or machines, and the user should ensure its security.
	If correctly setup, the user can now access all the servers without introducing any passwords. Definitely
	very convenient.</p>

<p>There are many configurations possible to enable SSH keys. On the client side, the default configuration requires:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To have, on each account supporting a SSH connection, a <span class="mark">~/.ssh</span> folder that must
		be <span class="mark">chmod 700</span>: that is, only accessible by the account's owner.</li>

	<li>To store on this folder the SSH key, named <span class="mark">id_rsa</span> 
		(will be named <span class="mark">id_dsa</span> if the SSH key's type is DSA). Furthermore, this file
		must be <span class="mark">chmod 600</span>: that is, only accessible by the account's owner.</li>
</ul>

<p>The command</p>
		<pre>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096</pre>
<p>achieves these requirements, producing a 4096 bits RSA key: 
		it creates by default the file <span class="mark">~/.ssh/id_rsa</span> with the
		right permissions, and, if missing, it creates also the <span class="mark">~/.ssh</span> folder, chmod-ed to 700.
		When this command is executed, the user is prompted to enter a passphrase: although is not mandatory to 
		introduce one, it is sensible to have one in most cases.
</p>

<p>In fact, the <span class="mark">ssh-keygen</span> creates two files: <span class="mark">~/.ssh/id_rsa</span>,
	the private key, and <span class="mark">~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</span>, that is the public key. This public
	key can be sent to as many hosts as required -no security concerns here-.</p>

<p>On the server side, the default configuration requires:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To have, on each account supporting a SSH connection, a <span class="mark">~/.ssh</span> folder that must
		be <span class="mark">chmod 700</span>: that is, only accessible by the account's owner.</li>

	<li>To store on this folder a file called <span class="mark">authorized_keys</span>, 
		also <span class="mark">chmod 600</span>.
		This file contains each accepted public key, one per line. 
		The <a href="http://man.he.net/man5/authorized_keys">format of this file</a> allows to specify 
		options associated to each key, to restrict the associated SSH connection or to perform specific actions
		when the connection is established.</li>
	
</ul>


<p>So, very basically, the process is:</p>
<ol><li>If you still have no SSH key, create one -using <span class="mark">ssh-keygen</span>-, 
	    and store the private key as <span class="mark">~/.ssh/id_rsa</span> on the client machine
	    or machines.</li>
	<li>Include the public key in the file <span class="mark">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span> of each account and server
		where it is required the SSH connection: <pre>cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</pre></li>
	<li>Ensure that the permissions are correct: chmod 700 on the <span class="mark">~/.ssh</span> folder, and chmod 600
		on the folder's files.</li>
</ol>


<p>Once this setup is in place, the exact behaviour depends on the particular linux distribution. The objective is to
	issue the SSH connection command and not to have to enter the passphrase on each attempt. This can be achieved,
	of course, by using SSH keys without passphrase, which is difficult to recommend on most scenarios. The
	alternative is based on the <span class="mark">ssh_agent</span> implementation, that provides a secure way of
	handling the passphrase(s). In OsX, the ssh-agent is integrated with the keychain, so each time the passphrase is
	required, the Keychain will check if it already knowns the passphrase. If not, a dialog will appear, looking as:</p>

<p><img src="osx_keychain.png" class="centered"></p>

<p>So, the first time the SSH access is required, the Keychain mechanisms in Os X will kick in, presenting that dialog.
	If the password is added to the keychain, it will not be requested any longer: objective achieved.</p>

<p>Similar mechanisms exist in linux, like the KWallet in KDE or the GNOME keyring. From the command line is
   definitely possible handling the SSH certificates:</p>

   <pre>ssh-add</pre>

   <p>Adds the private key to the keyring, asking for the passphrase if the key has one. This command requires to
   	have the <span class="mark">ssh-agent</span> running -and the environment variable SSH_AUTH_SOCK correctly setup,
   	but this will normally be the case (otherwise, starting ssh-agent automatically displays the required
   	environment variables to set).</p>

   	<p>It is also possible to add the keys to the ssh-agent automatically on each session, just by adding to your 
   		<span class="mark">~/.xsession</span> file the line <span class="mark">ssh-add</span>, although this
   		requires to have the <span class="mark">ssh-askpass</span> package installed.</p>


<h2>ssh-agent: use it</h2>

<p>So, to be able to so SSH connections without entering each time a password, it is needed to use SSH keys.
	And to use SSH keys without entering a passphrase, it is needed to use the ssh-agent (or Keychain in OsX).
	And the result is not only a higher convenience, but an increased security. Quoting from this
	<a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/64">weblog entry</a>: when you authenticate 
	to a text-based channel on a remote server, you should never have to type anything about that authentication 
	into the channel that will eventually be controlled by the remote server.</p>

<p>Of course, the security is only increased if some conditions are met: once the keyring is accessible, 
	anybody with access to the login session can reach the SSH servers without entering any passwords or
	passphrase. For example, a laptop with sensible SSH login keys should remain always secure -blocking sessions 
	on standby, or after some idle time-.


<h2>Multiple SSH keys</h2>

<p>In principle, there is need for one single SSH key. But although it is overkilling having multiple keys for multiple
   services or hosts, like, for example, one for each subversion or git repository's server, there are
   still many scenarios where having multiple keys is the most sensible action.</p>

   <p>One such scenario is to configure a SSH key without a passphrase to permit automation of operations over SSH,
   	but most commonly is due to security concerns: a laptop could use a key that has granted access to only a
   	subset of all the services or servers, or with granted access to accounts with lower permissions.</p>

   	<p>To generate SSH keys on specific files, the flag <span class="mark">-f</span> is used on
   		<span class="mark">ssh-keygen</span>:</p>

		<pre>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f KEYS_FILE -C COMMENT</pre>

	<p>The generated public key is added to the servers in the same way; the <span class="mark">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span>
		file in the server can have multiple keys associated to the same client. For the client to use this 
		new key instead of the default one, it must do so explicitly, and the way to do so depends in fact on the
		used tool. To open a SSH connection using ssh:</p>

	<pre>ssh -i KEYS_FILE user@host</pre>

	<p>Or just using an alias:</p>

	<pre>alias ssh="ssh -i KEYS_FILE"</pre>

	<p>If the key is used for a subversion access via SSH, an environment variable can be set:</p>

		<pre>export SVN_SSH="ssh -i KEYS_FILE user@host"</pre>


	<p>It is also possible to configure SSH to directly use multiple keys, by providing a file 
		<span class="mark">~/.ssh/config</span>. This file can contain multiple entries such as:</p>

<pre>IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.home
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.work</pre>

	<p>Now, both keys are used all the time; even better, it is possible to define the key selection
	   based on the server, like:</p>	

<pre>Host *.coderazzi.net
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.coderazzi

Host *.coderazzi.com
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.coderazzi.com
	User coderazzi

Host *.codingnight.net
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.cn
	User coderazzi
	Port 5623</pre>


<h2>Maintenance</h2>

<p>SSH keys maintenance includes the change of passphrases, and the renewal of keys</p>

<p>For the same reasons that it is recommended to change periodically your account's password[s],
	the passphrases in the SSH keys should be also periodically changed, using the 
	flag <span class="mark">-p</span> on <span class="mark">ssh-keygen</span>:</p>

	<pre>ssh-keygen -p [-f KEYS_FILE]</pre>

<p>Changing the passphrase does not impact the public key, it only changes the private key.
	So, if there are reasons to believe that the private key is compromised, changing the
	passphrase is definitely not enough: new keys should be generated, and the existing public key
	replaced on all related servers.</p>

<h2>Core stuff</h2>

<p>This small tutorial covers only the basic of making a default SSH setup work on Linux or OsX. The very basics.
	There are related concepts like the 
	<a href="http://blog.rootshell.be/2010/11/03/bruteforcing-ssh-known_hosts-files/">known_hosts</a> file, 
	<a href="http://www.x.org/archive/X11R6.8.1/doc/xauth.1.html">xauth</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.cmdln.org/2008/02/11/restricting-ssh-commands/">restricting ssh commands</a>, using different
	SSH protocol versions, etc, etc, etc.
