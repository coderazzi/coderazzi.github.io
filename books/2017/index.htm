            I purchased this audiobook following recommendations in audible. It is the kind of book I despise -mostly a monologue of a guy and its thoughts-,
            an obsession in words imploring me to just close the book or stop the audio, and still,
            I kept forward, and finished it, and well, kind of enjoyed it without enjoying its darkness at all.
        </p><p>
            It is a very good book, but a book that I feel as endured, and which I can hardly recommend, if only by how disturbing it is.
        </p><p>
            BUT it is still very interesting, and while all the characters but the main one are just shallow descriptions, and the main one is completely outbounds, it feels -too badly- real.

            I plainly love cheese. Almost as much as I loathe cheese excess, and this book is just overwhelmed on its usage for cheesy situations. Remove them all, take out some of the technology over-wisdom, and this would be a fantastic book.
        </p><p>
            As it is, it remains an enjoyable read, once to fast-forward more often than expected, and a forgetable once at that.

            This book is a lovely disaster. The plot is right, but with abominable sewing points.
        </p><p>
             It is not unbelievable, but almost. But if you can cope with that, well, it makes for a nice story. It is a Sunday thriller, the one to make no questions about, just to digest and have a good time.

            It is a good story, although at moments it looks more like a tele novel. 
        </p><p>
            Interesting for the possibly well documentation on banking story, stimulating for the ambition of the characters, but played down for the simpleness of those characters, and the overall artificial background, that makes the book look like a movie to be played, or a cheap romance novel. 
        </p><p>
            The overall result is something that it is enjoyable, but utterly mediocre.

            Fantastic
        </p><p>
            This book just redefines what is fast-paced. It follows a very curious line for its travel-time idea, but then it is executed at perfection, paradoxes and all.
        </p><p>
            Characters are really bland, just simple definitions of its roles in the story, but that goes very well with the style. As in <a href="#we_are_legion">We Are Legion</a>, this is a series of 3 books -but only two books so far- but here the story keeps its suspense all along, making for a superb read. Waiting to see what will be the 3rd book about....
        </p><p>
            And the narrator, well, he really gives live to the book, playing really well with different accents for each actor.

        </p>

        <p>
            Very original science fiction plot -even if centered around a non novel idea: already used -at least-, in the <a href="../2013/index.html#TheFootprintsOfGod">Foodprints Of God</a>. The author exhibits ample doses of humour, and definitely great knowledge of physics, which makes for a very stimulating read.
        </p><p>
            It is a series of 3 books, skilfully separated to get the reader to get to the next one. Unfortunately, the story loses quickly its charm, and although the whole series of 3 books is definitely good, it is mostly lingering on the good effect of the initial story. 
        </p><p>
            The scenarios drawn during all the books, of interactions with other cultures, or even with the remaining of the Earth civilisations are almost childish on its naive attempts. I can heartly recommend the first book, the rest are a lose of time.

        <p>
            I had to get to the wikipedia to reaffirm my understanding of what a butterfly effect is: the concept that states "small causes can have larger effects".
        </p><p>
            This book is not The Butterfly effect, but The Pornhub effect, the direct causes resulted by the implementation of a free porn site. This book was probably just a series about Porn, or directly Pornhub, later modded into a nicer and less frightening title. But it is still an interesting story, and short at that, so why not educating yourself?

        <p>
            I have read this book at least 3 times in the past, two in Spanish, one in English. 
            First time would be around 1986, last time in 2000. Like the story in the book, I must be following some kind of cycle, as I definitely enjoyed once more this read -listen, this time-. 
        </p><p>
            It is formidable, just story after story, stories inside stories, the fertile imagination of Stephen King in full motion. I am not sure what I enjoyed the most, if the narration, the stories themselves, the way each stories would be tight together, or the friendship core, but I really clapped when the narrator ended his performance. 
        </p><p>
            It is a very long story, and just not long enough.

        <p>
            A very short story, very much on the style of Stephen King,
            but with all the horror removed.
            Many books from King have a very long prologue, a great narration of events, of lives,
            of actors, just a presentation before the horror, or the strange events appear.
        </p><p>
            This little story is limited to that presentation.
            The authors could have opted for starting with the horror unleashed by the box.... or just end the book the way they did.

        <p>
            This book took me well over 12 months to read!
            This says more about my current reading habits than about the story itself, but I was definitely not very engaged with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It takes an interesting approach to time travelling;
            however, the focus is definitely not on the time travel itself, while the story described is all but forgettable.
            It remembers me poorly to 11/22/63, where Stephen King uses a much more interesting
            time travelling story to describe a much greater story surrounding the assassination of Kennedy.

        <p>
            After reading First Man in Rome, the only real possibility was continuing with the Masters of Rome series.
            So, in -not so rapid- succession, I went throught:
        </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Three Grass Crown (1991)</li>
            <li>Fortune's Favourites (1993)</li>
            <li>Caesar's Women (1996)</li>
            <li>Caesar (1998)</li>
            <li>The October Horse (2002)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            With the same attention to details, the interesting described events makes these books fast page-turners.
            The style of The October Horse is rather different than in the previous books in the series,
            taking a more distant approach to the main character (Caesar).
            While on the first books the reader becomes one with the described character,
            in The October Horse I felt more like an spectator in the events.
        </p><p>
            Somehow it diminishes the pleasure of reading it,
            and I have stopped the series for the time being, as I do not plan to read for the time being
            the a seventh book in the series, Anthony and Cleopatra (2007).
