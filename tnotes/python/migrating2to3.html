<h1>Short experiences migrating programs to Python 3</h1>

<p>After I migrated yesterday a short program, <a href="../../python/optmatch/index.html">optmatch</a>
to python 3.0, I decided to write on the experience, not so much as to list the problems I faced, 
but to be able to remember the subtle changes later on: I should extend the list as I migrate 
other programs. Currently, it just includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#list.sort">[].sort does not accept cmp argument</a></li>
<li><a href="#filter.iterator">filter, map returns an iterator, not a list</a></li>
<li><a href="#map.none">map's function cannot be None</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My first stop place was <a href="http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/">Dive Into Python 3</a>,
specially the 
<a href="http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/porting-code-to-python-3-with-2to3.html">porting</a> document.
I do not include here anything already included there, like printing being now a function, and, if I
do, is only to refer to my own experience about the change.</p>
 
<p>The program I migrated was quite short, around 1300 lines, and the accompanying unit tests reach just below 2000 lines, so I am pretty sure
that the problems I solved were a subset of the normal headaches a more usual migration would 
take.</p>

<p>I was more interested on getting to know Python 3, than just migrating my program. So I did use
<a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/library/2to3.html">2to3.py</a>, but more for curiosity, at first,
and later, to know how it would handle some idioms not valid anymore in Python 3.</p>


<h2><a name="list.sort">[].sort does not accept cmp argument</a></h2>

<p>In python 2.x, <span class="code">[].sort</span> supports 3 arguments: <span class="code">key, 
reverse, cmp</span>. The latest is gone in Python 3.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://bytes.com/groups/python/844614-python-3-sorting-comparison-function">this 
thread</a> I read the reasoning behind: people normally uses <span class="code">cmp</span>, but
using <span class="code">key</span> would produce better and shorter solutions, and in most cases
it is very easy to transform a sorting based on the <span class="code">cmp</span> argument into
one based on the <span class="code">key</span> argument.</p>

<p>The same thread proposes using the following function to convert a sorting based on 
<span class="code">cmp</span>:</p>

<pre>
def cmp2key(mycmp):
    "Converts a cmp= function into a key= function"
    class K:
        def __init__(self, obj, *args):
            self.obj = obj
        def __cmp__(self, other):
            return mycmp(self.obj, other.obj)
    return K

s.sort(key=cmp2key(cmp))
</pre>

<p>This struck me as odd, for its zealotry to force a solution seen as better, and for the
need to include the new function into the code.</p>

<p>I had some code such as:</p>

<pre>functionsAndPriorities.sort(lambda x, y: y[0] - x[0])</pre>

<p>This is the kind of code that the thread refered to, as it could have been written:</p>

<pre>functionsAndPriorities.sort(key=lambda x: -x[0])</pre>

<p>That is nicer, shorter, and probably faster. But I had this other code which does not seem so
suitable for a change:</p>

<pre>
   def compare(a, b):
       #first: give less weight to options than to flags
       noflag = isinstance(a, OptionInfo)
       if noflag != isinstance(b, OptionInfo):
           return (noflag and 1) or - 1
       #then: alphabetical order, case insensitive
       A = a.name.lower()    
       B = b.name.lower()
       return (A < b="" and="" -="" 1)="" or="" (a=""> B and 1) or 0
        
   ret.sort(compare)
</pre>

<p>Using <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/library/2to3.html">2to3.py</a> was not help,
as it let unchanged any code related to the <span class="code">sort + cmp</span> problem.</p>

<p>But, in fact, the change is quite easy, so I had to agree (so far, at least), with the reasoning
to remove the argument:</p>

<pre>
ret.sort(key=lambda x: (isinstance(x, OptionInfo), x.name.lower()))
</pre>

<p>Conclusion: better to realize that <span class="code">[].sort</span> has no 
<span class="code">cmp</span> argument anymore, and be ready to spend some time 
replacing comparison functions, because the change seems to be for the better.</p>





<h2><a name="filter.iterator">filter, map returns an iterator, not a list</a></h2>

<p>This change seems quite harmless: it is.</p>

<p>The easier way to change old code that would expect a list, would be adding it explicitly:</p>

<pre>filter(....) -> list(filter(...))</pre>

<p>Interestingly, <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/library/2to3.html">2to3.py</a> removes any 
usage of the <span class="code">filter</span> function. For example:</p>

<pre>return self.providedPars or filter(lambda x: x != [], self.provided.values())</pre>

<p>Is replaced by:</p>

<pre>return self.providedPars or [x for x in list(self.provided.values()) if x != []]</pre>

<p>The only problem that I have experienced with <span class="code">filter</span> returning an iterator
is on the idioms where I evaluated directly the returned value as a boolean expression. For example,
to check if any element in a list is an odd number, I would have written:</p>

<pre>if filter(lambda x: x%2, lst): #do anything</pre>

<p>This code is useless in Python 3, as the returned value is an iterator, and will evaluate as True
even if the list to iterate is empty. <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.0/library/2to3.html">2to3.py</a>
will replace the previous code with:</p>

<pre>if [x for x in lst if x%2]:</pre>

<p>But this means that the whole list is calculated, which defeats the benefit of having 
<span class="code">filter</span> returning an iterator: as soon as an element in the list is
evaluated as odd, there is no need to evaluate the rest of the list, which can be written as:</p>

<pre>if any(filter(lambda x: x%2, lst)): #do anything</pre>

<p>Conclusion: learn the new feature, and try to get advantage of the performance improvements.
And get to know added functions, like  <span class="any">any</span></p>



<h2><a name="map.none">map's function cannot be None</a></h2>

<p>I haven't yet understood the reason for this change. If you have a number of lists with
different number of elements, using <span class="code">map(None, lst1, ...)</span> is equivalent to
using <span class="code">zip(lst1, ...)</span>, but it will returns as many tuples as elements are
in the larger passed list, filling the other lists with None elements.</p>
<p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
a=[1, 2, 3]
b=[10, 20]
map(None, a, b)
</pre>
<p>Returns, in python 2.x: 
<pre>[(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, None)]</pre>

<p>In Python 3, you obtain a <span class="code">TypeError</span> exception:</p>
<pre>TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable</pre>

<p>There is no offered alternative for this behaviour. It must be coded explicitly, such as:</p>
<pre>
   def oldMapNone(*a):
       '''A replace for map(None, ....), invalid in 3.0 :-( '''
       m = max([len(each) for each in a])
       return list(zip(* [each + [None] * (m - len(each)) for each in a]))
</pre>

<p>Conclusion: why? I presume there must be some reason lying somewhere, but so far I didn't find it.</p>

<p><span class="mark">Update:</span> I posted this question on the Python forums, and I got pretty fast an answer, not
on the philosophical grounds for the change, but on how to code it now:</p>

<p><span class="mark">Use itertools.zip_longest().</span></p>

<p>(Thanks to Raymonf Hettinger for the answer)</p>
