<p class="note">A detail on the notation used: Mono is a .Net implementation, available for several operative systems.
But, in this page, .Net, unless otherwise stated, refers to the Microsoft implementation for Windows.</p>

<h1>GAC: Windows and Mono</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="#gacinmono">GAC in Mono</a></li>
<li><a href="#mononet">Mono and .Net</a></li>
<li><a href="#monomono">Mono and Mono</a></li>
<li><a href="#onlygac">One only GAC for .Net and Mono?</a></li>
<li><a href="#nunit">NUnit case</a></li>
<li><a href="#links">Related links</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The GAC, the global assembly cache, is the solution in .Net to hold shared assemblies (libraries) 
with multiple versions.</p>

<p>Basically .Net defines one location -a directory- where these assemblies are stored. 
Note that assemblies do not need to be installed in the GAC, and that there could be multiple GAC directories; 
it is, anyway, a global repository.</p>

<p>Logically, a library called LIBRARY, with versions 1.0 and 2.0, would be stored, under the GAC, as:<ul>
<li>LIBRARY\1.0\library.dll</li>
<li>LIBRARY\2.0\library.dll</li></ul><p>

<p>The implementation is a bit more complicated; version numbers include 4 figures, 
the directory name for each version includes a public key and digital signature, 
and there is also support for 'cultures', so that a version of the same library for Spanish and English, 
for example, can coexist.</p>

<p>For example, a -quite old- version of Nunit is installed as:</p>
<div class="scode">c:\WINDOWS\assembly\GAC_MSIL\nunit.framework\2.2.9.0__96d09a1eb7f44a77\nunit.framework.dll</div>

<p>When a library or executable is created, it must include references to any external used assemblies. 
There is no magic here; if I intend to use the version 2.2.9.0 of the Nunit framework, my compilation must 
include, somehow, the previous location.</p>

<p>This location is not harcoded in the generated library/executable. 
Instead, it will contain a manifest that references the strong version name of the referenced library. 
Something like:</p>

<pre class="code">.assembly extern nunit.framework
{
  .publickeytoken = (96 D0 9A 1E B7 F4 4A 77 )
  .ver 2:2:9:0
}</pre>

<p>Now, when this assembly/executable is used, the .Net runtime knows that it requires a library called 
nunit.frameword, with version 2.2.9.0 and token 96d09a1eb7f44a77, and it will look for this library in the 
GAC (in fact, it looks as well other places, like the current directory). Unless there is any specific 
versioning policy, this <b>exact</b> assembly version must be found in the GAC, or the execution will fail.</p>


<h2><a name="gacinmono">GAC in Mono</a></h2>

<p>Mono uses a similar approach. If MONO_HOME is the location where Mono was installed, the GAC is initially 
located under:</p>

<div class="scode">MONO_HOME/lib/mono/gac</div>

<p>In this location, the structure is exacly as defined for .Net; you could find the nunit.framework.dll under:</p>

<div class="scode">MONO_HOME/lib/mono/gac/nunit.framework/2.2.9.0__96d09a1eb7f44a77/nunit.framework.dll</div>

<p>The directory MONO_HOME/lib/mono, in addition to the GAC, contains a set of directories named 
1.0, 2.0, and 2.1 -as of Mono 1.2.6-. These are the directories where the Mono compilers will look 
for shared assemblies if they cannot find them in the other default locations -directory of the executing 
assembly or the MONO_PATH directory, if defined-.</p>

<p>There are, with Mono 1.2.6, three C# compilers: mcs (version 1.0), gmcs 
(version 2.0, supporting generics) and smcs (version 2.1, supporting Silverlight). 
For example, mcs will use the directory MONO_HOME/lib/mono/1.0 to find global assemblies. 
Obviously, this means that we cannot have multiple versions of the same library to be used by default 
-just the one version located in this directory-.</p>


<h2><a name="mononet">Mono and .Net</a></h2>

<p>So, what happens if you try to compile or use an assembly -that works properly in .Net- under Mono? 
Letting aside probably compatibily issues, in case that the assembly uses a feature not yet ported into Mono, 
there is the problem of using the GAC. Mono and .Net define different GACs, so an assembly located in the 
.Net GAC will not be available for Mono. </p>

<p>This can be easily solved: just copy the assembly, with all directory names, from one GAC to the another. 
But note that this operation cannot be done from Windows Explorer, as a shell extension hides the internal 
GAC structure. However, it can be done from the command line.</p>

<p>For example, to copy the version 2.2.9.0 of nunit.framework.dll from .Net to Mono GAC's, do:</p>

<pre class="code"><b>C:\WINDOWS\assembly\GAC_MSIL\nunit.framework>
xcopy . "\Program Files\Mono-1.2.6\lib\mono\gac\nunit.framework" /s</b>
.\2.2.9.0__96d09a1eb7f44a77\nunit.framework.dll
1 File(s) copied</pre>

<p>If you want to make this specific version available for the gmcs compiler, it is needed now to 
copy that dll into the associated directory:</p>

<pre class="code"><b>C:\Program Files\Mono-1.2.6\lib\mono>
copy gac\nunit.framework\2.2.9.0__96d09a1eb7f44a77\nunit.framework.dll 2.0</b>
        1 file(s) copied.</pre> 
        
        
<h2><a name="monomono">Mono and Mono</a></h2>

<p>The previous point covered the case where an assembly is available under the .Net GAC but not under 
the Mono GAC; but, as it happens, there can be problems on the way Mono is distributed.</p>

<p>For example, Mono 1.2.6 is delivered with NUnit, versions 2.2.0.0 and 2.2.8.0:</p>

<pre class="code"><b>C:\Program Files\Mono-1.2.6\lib\mono>dir gac\nunit.framework</b>
 Volume in drive C is Programs
 Volume Serial Number is F8BC-7489

 Directory of C:\Program Files\Mono-1.2.6\lib\mono\gac\nunit.framework

01/18/2008  01:15 AM    &lt;DIR&gt;          .
01/18/2008  01:15 AM    &lt;DIR&gt;          ..
12/20/2007  09:24 AM    &lt;DIR&gt;          2.2.0.0__96d09a1eb7f44a77
12/20/2007  09:24 AM    &lt;DIR&gt;          2.2.8.0__96d09a1eb7f44a77
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               4 Dir(s)  23,652,917,248 bytes free</pre>
               
<p>But if you try to compile a project referencing the nunit.framework assembly using gmcs, it will fail, 
stating that it cannot find that assembly. However, using the mcs compiler, it will find that assembly. 
Unfortunately, gmcs is the compiler required when using generics.</p>

<p>The problem is that the directory MONO_HOME/lib/mono/1.0 contains a copy of the nunit.framework.dll 
(one of the two available versions, that is), and this copy is not present in MONO_HOME/lib/mono/2.0</p>

<p>The solution is to make that copy available under 2.0:</p>

<pre class="code"><b>C:\Program Files\Mono-1.2.6\lib\mono>xcopy 1.0\nunit.framework.dll 2.0</b>
1.0\nunit.framework.dll
1 File(s) copied
</pre>

<p>Please note that there can be reasons why an assembly is available to one compiler's version but not the other.</p>


<h2><a name="onlygac">One only GAC for .Net and Mono?</a></h2>

<p>As both GACs share the same structure, I would expect that it would be possible to setup a machine with 
both .Net versions using a single GAC. Mono supports the environment variable MONO_GAC_PREFIX to define 
a different GAC location, but it is not possible to setup this variable to the .Net GAC, because Mono 
automatically appends /lib/mono/gac to this environment variable.</p>

<p>In any case, the operation would not be that simple. .Net has 3 different GAC locations, all 
under \windows\assembly. There is GAC, GAC_32 and GAC_MSIL, depending on whether the assembly run in 32 or 64 bits, 
or on both. and even if there would be just one .Net location, it would be probably not such a good idea to 
let both runtimes deal with this structure. </p>

<h2><a name="nunit">NUnit case</a></h2>

<p>Although this note uses NUnit as example, the information shown so far does not really solve the problem of
using .Net on Mono 1.2.6 with generics. That is, on a fresh Mono 1.2.6 installation, a compilation requiring
gmcs and NUnit will fail as:</p>

<pre class="code">error CS0006: cannot find metadata file `nunit.framework.dll'</pre>

<p>The solution is not so simple as to copy a valid nunit.framework.dll into the mono gac. 
Mono is deployed with a NUnit executable (launched via nunit-console2) which relies itself on nunit.core.dll,
nunit.framework.dll and nutil.util.dll, all of them in version 2.2.0.0. So, if that is the executable on use to
test Nunit, the previous dlls must be made available on the gac and compiler's areas.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, version 2.2 is a bit old (August 2004), so you can run into different compatibility problems;
in this case, the best would be to install NUnit from source.</p>
